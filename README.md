## 🗃️ Database Design

This project uses a relational database structure to manage data related to users, listings, bookings, and transactions. Below are the key entities and their relationships:

### 👤 Users
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Full name of the user
- `email`: User's email address (unique)
- `role`: Indicates if the user is a guest or a host
- `created_at`: Timestamp of account creation

**Relationships**:
- A user can own multiple properties.
- A user can make multiple bookings.
- A user can leave multiple reviews.

---

### 🏡 Properties
- `id`: Unique property identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the owner (host)
- `title`: Title or name of the property
- `location`: Address or coordinates
- `price_per_night`: Rental price

**Relationships**:
- A property belongs to one user (host).
- A property can have multiple bookings and reviews.

---

### 📅 Bookings
- `id`: Unique booking identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the guest
- `property_id`: Foreign key referencing the booked property
- `start_date`: Start date of the booking
- `end_date`: End date of the booking

**Relationships**:
- A booking is made by one user (guest).
- A booking is for one property.

---

### ✍️ Reviews
- `id`: Unique review identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the reviewer
- `property_id`: Foreign key referencing the reviewed property
- `rating`: Numerical rating (e.g., 1 to 5)
- `comment`: Textual review

**Relationships**:
- A review is written by one user.
- A review belongs to one property.

---

### 💳 Payments
- `id`: Unique payment identifier
- `booking_id`: Foreign key referencing the related booking
- `amount`: Total amount paid
- `payment_method`: e.g., credit card, PayPal
- `status`: e.g., completed, pending, failed

**Relationships**:
- A payment is tied to one booking.
